## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-22

### üöÄ Production Deployment Audit - Major Performance & Security Improvements

#### Build & Bundling
- **Added** Bundle analyzer with `rollup-plugin-visualizer` for production builds
- **Enhanced** Vite configuration with production optimizations:
  - Disabled sourcemaps in production
  - Enabled tree-shaking with `target: 'esnext'`
  - Optimized manual chunks for better code splitting
  - Disabled `modulePreload` for improved performance
- **Added** New npm scripts: `analyze`, `preview`, `lint`, `format`, `typecheck`
- **Optimized** Bundle splitting with vendor chunks for React, UI components, icons, and utilities

#### Frontend Performance
- **Enhanced** Image compressor component with React performance optimizations:
  - Added `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Implemented image metadata extraction (width/height) during file processing
  - Added compression statistics calculation and display
  - Optimized file processing with async operations
- **Created** Web Worker (`image-compression.worker.ts`) for heavy image compression operations
- **Improved** Component structure and user experience with better progress indicators

#### Backend/API Security
- **Enhanced** Security headers with comprehensive helmet configuration:
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) with strict directives
  - Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with preload and subdomain inclusion
  - X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection
  - Referrer Policy set to "no-referrer"
- **Improved** CORS configuration with origin validation and restricted methods
- **Fixed** CORS issues in development mode while maintaining strict security in production
- **Enhanced** Rate limiting with different limits for different endpoints
- **Added** File validation with MIME type checking and size limits
- **Implemented** Input sanitization and validation for all API endpoints
- **Enhanced** Error handling with production-safe error messages

#### Privacy & Logging
- **Enhanced** PII redaction in logs with comprehensive field masking
- **Added** Security logging with IP addresses and user agents
- **Improved** log format and truncation for better readability
- **Enhanced** error logging with stack traces in development only

#### Repository Hygiene
- **Enhanced** `.gitignore` with comprehensive patterns for:
  - Build artifacts and dependencies
  - Development tools and IDE files
  - Environment files and secrets
  - Test coverage and analysis reports
- **Added** TypeScript type definitions for all dependencies
- **Improved** build verification and production scripts

#### Testing & Verification
- **Enhanced** existing smoke tests with better error handling
- **Added** comprehensive build verification script
- **Improved** test execution and reporting

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Upgraded** dependencies and resolved security vulnerabilities
- **Added** proper TypeScript types for all external packages
- **Implemented** modern ES modules throughout the codebase
- **Enhanced** error handling and validation across all endpoints

### üö® Breaking Changes
- None - all changes are backward compatible

### üìù Migration Notes
- Update environment variables for CORS configuration if needed
- Ensure proper SSL/TLS setup for HSTS headers
- Configure rate limiting thresholds based on production requirements

### üîí Security Notes
- All security headers are now properly configured
- CORS is restricted to specified origins only
- Rate limiting is implemented for all API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization is enforced

### üìä Performance Targets
- Target: Lighthouse Performance ‚â• 95
- Target: Main JS bundle ‚â§ 200 KB gzipped
- Target: First Interaction < 2.5s
- Target: TTFB < 1s on simple pages
